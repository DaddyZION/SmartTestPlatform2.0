# Answers

## Section A

1.  b) 6 || **Explanation:** Carbon has an atomic number of 6, which means it has 6 protons in its nucleus. The atomic number is the defining characteristic of an element and determines its position on the periodic table.
2.  c) Helium || **Explanation:** Helium is a noble gas in Group 18 of the periodic table. Noble gases have complete outer electron shells, making them chemically inert under normal conditions.
3.  b) Ionic bond || **Explanation:** Sodium (Na) is a metal that loses an electron to become Na⁺, while chlorine (Cl) is a non-metal that gains an electron to become Cl⁻. The electrostatic attraction between these oppositely charged ions forms an ionic bond.
4.  b) 7 || **Explanation:** At 25°C, pure water has a pH of 7, which is considered neutral. This means the concentration of H⁺ ions equals the concentration of OH⁻ ions (both are 10⁻⁷ M).
5.  a) 6.022 × 10²³ || **Explanation:** Avogadro's number is 6.022 × 10²³ and represents the number of particles (atoms, molecules, ions) in one mole of a substance. This is a fundamental constant in chemistry.

## Section B

1.  c) CH₄ || **Explanation:** Methane is the simplest hydrocarbon with one carbon atom bonded to four hydrogen atoms. It is the primary component of natural gas and follows the general formula for alkanes (CₙH₂ₙ₊₂).
2.  c) Evaporation || **Explanation:** Evaporation is the process by which molecules in a liquid state gain enough energy to enter the gas phase. This occurs at the surface of the liquid and can happen at any temperature below the boiling point.
3.  a) 1s² 2s² 2p⁴ || **Explanation:** Oxygen has 8 electrons. Following the aufbau principle, these electrons fill the orbitals in order: 1s² (2 electrons), 2s² (2 electrons), and 2p⁴ (4 electrons), totaling 8 electrons.
4.  d) Avogadro's Law || **Explanation:** Avogadro's Law states that equal volumes of gases at the same temperature and pressure contain equal numbers of molecules. This law is fundamental to the concept of the mole and gas stoichiometry.
5.  b) +6 || **Explanation:** In H₂SO₄, hydrogen has an oxidation state of +1 and oxygen has -2. For the compound to be neutral: 2(+1) + S + 4(-2) = 0, so S = +6. Sulfur has an oxidation state of +6 in sulfuric acid.

## Section C

1.  b) Moles of solute / Volume of solution in L || **Explanation:** Molarity (M) is defined as the number of moles of solute divided by the volume of solution in liters. This gives the concentration in mol/L or M, which is the standard unit for solution concentration.
2.  c) sp³ || **Explanation:** In methane (CH₄), carbon forms four single bonds with hydrogen atoms. This requires four hybrid orbitals, which are formed by mixing one s orbital and three p orbitals, resulting in sp³ hybridization and tetrahedral geometry.
3.  c) Zn + CuSO₄ → ZnSO₄ + Cu || **Explanation:** This is a redox reaction where zinc is oxidized (loses electrons) from 0 to +2, and copper is reduced (gains electrons) from +2 to 0. Electrons are transferred between the species.
4.  b) The slowest step || **Explanation:** In a multi-step reaction, the rate-determining step is the slowest step because it limits the overall rate of the reaction. The reaction cannot proceed faster than its slowest step, similar to a bottleneck.
5.  c) A substance that speeds up the reaction without being consumed || **Explanation:** A catalyst increases the reaction rate by providing an alternative pathway with lower activation energy. It participates in the reaction but is regenerated at the end, so it's not consumed overall.

# Answers

## Section A

1.  b) Scarcity || **Explanation:** Scarcity is the fundamental economic problem where unlimited wants and needs exceed limited resources. This forces individuals and societies to make choices about how to allocate resources efficiently.
2.  d) Money || **Explanation:** The factors of production are land, labor, capital, and entrepreneurship. Money is a medium of exchange but not a factor of production itself - it is used to purchase the factors of production.
3.  a) Gross Domestic Product || **Explanation:** GDP stands for Gross Domestic Product, which measures the total value of all goods and services produced within a country's borders in a specific time period, usually a year.
4.  c) Price equals marginal revenue || **Explanation:** In perfect competition, firms are price takers, meaning they accept the market price. Since they can sell any quantity at the market price, the price equals the marginal revenue for each additional unit sold.
5.  b) An increase in the general price level || **Explanation:** Inflation is defined as a sustained increase in the general price level of goods and services in an economy over time. It reduces the purchasing power of money.

## Section B

1.  c) As price increases, quantity demanded decreases || **Explanation:** The law of demand states that there is an inverse relationship between price and quantity demanded, assuming all other factors remain constant. As prices rise, consumers typically buy less of a good or service.
2.  b) The value of the next best alternative forgone || **Explanation:** Opportunity cost is a fundamental economic concept representing the value of the best alternative that must be given up when making a choice. It reflects the trade-offs inherent in every decision.
3.  d) Monopolistic competition || **Explanation:** Monopolistic competition is characterized by many sellers offering differentiated products that are close substitutes. Examples include restaurants, clothing stores, and hair salons.
4.  a) Government policy on taxation and spending || **Explanation:** Fiscal policy refers to government decisions about taxation and spending to influence economic activity. It is one of the main tools governments use to manage the economy alongside monetary policy.
5.  c) An improvement in technology || **Explanation:** An improvement in technology typically increases productivity and reduces production costs, which shifts the supply curve to the right (increases supply). This allows producers to supply more at each price level.

## Section C

1.  a) When one economic change leads to larger overall changes || **Explanation:** The multiplier effect occurs when an initial change in spending leads to a larger change in total economic output. For example, increased government spending can stimulate additional rounds of spending throughout the economy.
2.  c) Changing interest rates || **Explanation:** Monetary policy involves central bank actions to influence the money supply and interest rates. Changing interest rates is a primary tool of monetary policy used to control inflation and stimulate economic growth.
3.  b) Nominal GDP is measured in current prices, real GDP is adjusted for inflation || **Explanation:** Nominal GDP measures output using current market prices, while real GDP adjusts for inflation by using constant base-year prices. Real GDP provides a better measure of actual economic growth.
4.  a) The responsiveness of quantity demanded to changes in price || **Explanation:** Price elasticity of demand measures how sensitive consumer demand is to price changes. It is calculated as the percentage change in quantity demanded divided by the percentage change in price.
5.  c) Increase in aggregate demand || **Explanation:** Demand-pull inflation occurs when aggregate demand exceeds aggregate supply at full employment. This can be caused by increased consumer spending, government expenditure, or investment, leading to upward pressure on prices.

# Answers

## Section A

1.  b) The warming of Earth's atmosphere due to trapped heat || **Explanation:** The greenhouse effect occurs when certain gases in the atmosphere trap heat from the sun, preventing it from escaping back to space. This natural process keeps Earth warm enough to support life, but human activities have enhanced it.
2.  c) Carbon dioxide || **Explanation:** Carbon dioxide (CO₂) is the primary greenhouse gas contributing to global warming. It's released through burning fossil fuels, deforestation, and other human activities, and it persists in the atmosphere for centuries.
3.  b) The variety of life on Earth || **Explanation:** Biodiversity refers to the variety of life on Earth at all levels, including genetic diversity within species, species diversity within ecosystems, and ecosystem diversity across the planet.
4.  b) A community of organisms and their environment || **Explanation:** An ecosystem is a community of living organisms interacting with each other and their physical environment. It includes both biotic (living) and abiotic (non-living) components.
5.  b) A layer of gases that protects Earth from UV radiation || **Explanation:** The ozone layer is a region of Earth's stratosphere that contains high concentrations of ozone (O₃), which absorbs most of the sun's harmful ultraviolet radiation.

## Section B

1.  b) Sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide emissions || **Explanation:** Acid rain is caused by sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides released into the atmosphere from burning fossil fuels. These compounds react with water vapor to form sulfuric and nitric acids.
2.  c) Sunlight || **Explanation:** Sunlight is the primary source of energy for most ecosystems. Through photosynthesis, plants convert solar energy into chemical energy, which then flows through food chains and webs.
3.  b) The excessive growth of algae due to nutrient pollution || **Explanation:** Eutrophication occurs when water bodies receive excessive nutrients (particularly nitrogen and phosphorus), leading to algal blooms that deplete oxygen and harm aquatic life.
4.  d) Solar energy || **Explanation:** Solar energy is a renewable energy source because it's continuously replenished by the sun. Unlike fossil fuels, it won't be depleted through use and produces no direct emissions.
5.  b) Human activities || **Explanation:** The main cause of deforestation is human activities, including agriculture, logging, urban development, and infrastructure projects. These activities clear forests at rates much faster than natural regeneration.

## Section C

1.  b) The movement of carbon through Earth's systems || **Explanation:** The carbon cycle describes how carbon moves between the atmosphere, land, oceans, and living organisms. It includes processes like photosynthesis, respiration, decomposition, and combustion.
2.  b) Meeting present needs without compromising future generations || **Explanation:** Environmental sustainability is the principle of meeting current human needs while ensuring that future generations can meet their own needs. It involves using resources responsibly and protecting environmental systems.
3.  a) Weather is short-term, climate is long-term || **Explanation:** Weather refers to short-term atmospheric conditions (days to weeks), while climate refers to long-term average weather patterns over decades or centuries in a particular region.
4.  b) The increase in concentration of toxins up the food chain || **Explanation:** Biomagnification is the process by which the concentration of toxins increases at each level of the food chain. Top predators accumulate the highest concentrations of these persistent substances.
5.  b) Melting ice reducing surface reflectivity || **Explanation:** This is a positive feedback loop where melting ice exposes darker surfaces (water or land) that absorb more heat than reflective ice, leading to more warming and more melting in a self-reinforcing cycle.

# Answers

## Section A

1.  b) The study of speech sounds || **Explanation:** Phonetics is the branch of linguistics that studies the physical properties of speech sounds, including how they are produced, transmitted, and perceived.
2.  b) The smallest unit of meaning in language || **Explanation:** A morpheme is the smallest meaningful unit in language. For example, "cats" contains two morphemes: "cat" (the root) and "-s" (indicating plural).
3.  b) The study of sentence structure || **Explanation:** Syntax is the branch of linguistics that studies how words combine to form phrases and sentences. It examines the rules governing sentence structure.
4.  d) Astrology || **Explanation:** Astrology is not a branch of linguistics; it's the study of celestial bodies and their supposed influence on human affairs. The other options are all legitimate branches of linguistics.
5.  b) A unit of sound that can distinguish words || **Explanation:** A phoneme is the smallest unit of sound that can distinguish meaning between words. For example, /p/ and /b/ are different phonemes because they distinguish "pat" from "bat."

## Section B

1.  b) Prescriptive prescribes rules, descriptive describes how language is used || **Explanation:** Prescriptive grammar tells people how they should speak or write, while descriptive grammar describes how people actually use language without making value judgments.
2.  a) The study of how context affects meaning || **Explanation:** Pragmatics studies how context, speaker intention, and social factors affect the interpretation of meaning in communication beyond the literal meaning of words.
3.  b) A regional or social variety of a language || **Explanation:** A dialect is a variety of a language that differs in pronunciation, grammar, or vocabulary from other varieties, often associated with a particular region or social group.
4.  b) The idea that humans have an innate capacity for language || **Explanation:** Universal Grammar, proposed by Noam Chomsky, suggests that humans are born with an innate capacity for language acquisition and that all languages share certain fundamental properties.
5.  b) Changes in word meaning over time || **Explanation:** Semantic change refers to the evolution of word meanings over time. Words can broaden, narrow, or completely change their meanings through various linguistic and social processes.

## Section C

1.  b) Ferdinand de Saussure || **Explanation:** Ferdinand de Saussure is considered the father of modern linguistics. His work established linguistics as a scientific discipline and introduced key concepts like the distinction between langue and parole.
2.  c) The distinction is often political rather than linguistic || **Explanation:** The distinction between language and dialect is often based on political, social, or cultural factors rather than purely linguistic ones. The saying "a language is a dialect with an army and a navy" reflects this reality.
3.  b) Alternating between languages or dialects || **Explanation:** Code-switching is the practice of alternating between two or more languages or dialects within a single conversation or even within a single sentence, common in multilingual communities.
4.  b) There's an optimal time for language learning || **Explanation:** The critical period hypothesis suggests there's an optimal time period (typically before puberty) for language acquisition, after which it becomes much more difficult to achieve native-like proficiency.
5.  b) Language influences thought || **Explanation:** Linguistic relativity, also known as the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis, suggests that the language we speak influences how we think and perceive the world around us.

# Answers

## Section A

1.  b) Newton || **Explanation:** The Newton (N) is the SI unit of force, defined as the force required to accelerate one kilogram of mass at one meter per second squared. It is named after Sir Isaac Newton.
2.  d) Speed || **Explanation:** Speed is a scalar quantity because it only has magnitude and no direction. Velocity, acceleration, and force are vector quantities as they have both magnitude and direction.
3.  a) 9.8 m/s² || **Explanation:** The standard acceleration due to gravity on Earth is approximately 9.8 m/s² (or 9.81 m/s² more precisely). This value varies slightly depending on location and altitude.
4.  c) Newton's Third Law || **Explanation:** Newton's Third Law states that for every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction. This means that forces always occur in pairs - when one object exerts a force on another, the second object exerts an equal and opposite force back.
5.  a) 3 × 10⁸ m/s || **Explanation:** The speed of light in vacuum is approximately 3 × 10⁸ m/s (more precisely 299,792,458 m/s). This is a fundamental constant in physics and represents the maximum speed at which information can travel.

## Section B

1.  b) KE = ½mv² || **Explanation:** Kinetic energy is the energy of motion, calculated as one-half times the mass times the square of the velocity. This formula shows that kinetic energy increases with the square of velocity.
2.  d) Radio waves || **Explanation:** In the electromagnetic spectrum, radio waves have the longest wavelengths (ranging from about 1 meter to several kilometers) and the lowest frequencies, while gamma rays have the shortest wavelengths.
3.  c) Ohm || **Explanation:** The Ohm (Ω) is the SI unit of electrical resistance, named after Georg Ohm. It represents the resistance of a conductor when a potential difference of one volt produces a current of one ampere.
4.  b) V = IR || **Explanation:** Ohm's Law states that voltage (V) equals current (I) times resistance (R). This fundamental relationship describes how voltage, current, and resistance are related in electrical circuits.
5.  b) It decreases || **Explanation:** When light passes from air into water, its speed decreases because water has a higher refractive index than air. Since the frequency remains constant, the wavelength must decrease to maintain the relationship c = fλ.

## Section C

1.  a) Electromagnetic induction || **Explanation:** Transformers operate on the principle of electromagnetic induction, where a changing magnetic field in the primary coil induces a voltage in the secondary coil. This allows for voltage transformation in AC circuits.
2.  c) They are in opposite directions || **Explanation:** In simple harmonic motion, the acceleration is always directed toward the equilibrium position, while displacement is measured from the equilibrium position. This means they are always in opposite directions.
3.  a) 1 - T₂/T₁ || **Explanation:** The efficiency of a Carnot engine is given by η = 1 - T₂/T₁, where T₁ is the temperature of the hot reservoir and T₂ is the temperature of the cold reservoir (both in Kelvin). This represents the theoretical maximum efficiency.
4.  b) Position and momentum cannot be determined precisely simultaneously || **Explanation:** Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle states that there is a fundamental limit to how precisely we can simultaneously know both the position and momentum of a particle. The more precisely we know one, the less precisely we can know the other.
5.  b) The angle of incidence for which the angle of refraction is 90° || **Explanation:** The critical angle is the angle of incidence in the denser medium for which the angle of refraction is 90°. Beyond this angle, total internal reflection occurs, and no light is transmitted into the less dense medium.

# Answers

## Section A

1.  b) Sigmund Freud || **Explanation:** Sigmund Freud is widely considered the father of psychoanalysis. He developed theories about the unconscious mind, defense mechanisms, and the structure of personality (id, ego, superego).
2.  b) Mental processes || **Explanation:** Cognitive psychology focuses on mental processes such as thinking, memory, perception, decision-making, and problem-solving. It examines how people process information and make sense of their world.
3.  b) Hippocampus || **Explanation:** The hippocampus is crucial for memory formation, particularly the formation of new memories and spatial navigation. Damage to this area can result in severe memory impairments.
4.  c) Learning through association || **Explanation:** Classical conditioning, discovered by Ivan Pavlov, involves learning through association between stimuli. A neutral stimulus becomes associated with an unconditioned stimulus to produce a conditioned response.
5.  a) Abraham Maslow || **Explanation:** Abraham Maslow developed the hierarchy of needs, which suggests that human needs are arranged in a hierarchy from basic physiological needs to self-actualization. This theory is fundamental to humanistic psychology.

## Section B

1.  c) The study of mental processes and behavior || **Explanation:** Psychology is the scientific study of both mental processes (thoughts, emotions, perceptions) and behavior. It encompasses both observable actions and internal mental states.
2.  c) Experimental method || **Explanation:** The experimental method involves manipulating independent variables while controlling other factors to establish cause-and-effect relationships. It is the gold standard for psychological research when feasible.
3.  a) Confirmation bias || **Explanation:** Confirmation bias is the tendency to search for, interpret, and recall information in ways that confirm our pre-existing beliefs or hypotheses. It can lead to errors in reasoning and decision-making.
4.  d) REM sleep || **Explanation:** REM (Rapid Eye Movement) sleep is the stage most associated with vivid dreams. During this stage, brain activity is high, and most memorable dreams occur.
5.  a) Duration and capacity || **Explanation:** Short-term memory has limited duration (15-30 seconds) and capacity (7±2 items), while long-term memory has virtually unlimited duration and capacity. This is one of the key distinctions between these memory systems.

## Section C

1.  b) Cognitive-behavioral therapy || **Explanation:** Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) focuses on identifying and changing negative thought patterns and behaviors. It is based on the idea that thoughts, feelings, and behaviors are interconnected.
2.  b) Neuroplasticity || **Explanation:** Neuroplasticity refers to the brain's ability to reorganize itself by forming new neural connections throughout life. This ability allows the brain to adapt to new situations, learn new information, and recover from injury.
3.  c) Psychodynamic theory || **Explanation:** Psychodynamic theory, originated by Freud, suggests that behavior is largely determined by unconscious forces, childhood experiences, and internal conflicts between different parts of the personality.
4.  b) People are less likely to help when others are present || **Explanation:** The bystander effect occurs when people are less likely to offer help in an emergency when other people are present. This is often due to diffusion of responsibility and social influence.
5.  c) Actor-observer bias || **Explanation:** Actor-observer bias is the tendency to attribute our own behavior to external circumstances while attributing others' behavior to their internal characteristics. We have different perspectives on our own versus others' actions.

5.  b) Charles Horton Cooley || **Explanation:** Charles Horton Cooley developed the concept of the "looking-glass self," which suggests that our self-concept is shaped by how we think others perceive us. We see ourselves reflected in others' reactions to us.

## Section B

1.  b) Folkways are customs, mores are strongly held norms || **Explanation:** Folkways are informal norms governing everyday behavior (like table manners), while mores are strongly held norms that are considered essential to society's welfare (like prohibitions against murder or incest).
2.  b) Participant observation || **Explanation:** Participant observation is a research method where the researcher becomes part of the group being studied, observing behavior from within. This allows for deep understanding of social dynamics and cultural practices.
3.  a) A state of normlessness || **Explanation:** Anomie, according to Durkheim, is a condition where social norms are unclear or absent, leading to confusion and deviance. It often occurs during periods of rapid social change.
4.  c) Traditional authority || **Explanation:** Traditional authority, according to Max Weber, is based on established customs and traditions. Leaders gain authority through inheritance or long-standing cultural practices rather than elections or personal charisma.
5.  b) Changing one's social position || **Explanation:** Social mobility refers to the movement of individuals or groups within the social stratification system. It can be upward, downward, or horizontal, and may occur within a generation or between generations.

## Section C

2.  a) Achieved status is earned, ascribed status is given at birth || **Explanation:** Achieved status is a social position that a person attains through their own efforts and choices (like becoming a doctor), while ascribed status is assigned at birth or involuntarily (like race or gender).
3.  c) Bureaucratic ritualism || **Explanation:** Bureaucratic ritualism refers to the tendency of bureaucrats to focus so much on following rules and procedures that they lose sight of the organization's original goals, leading to inefficiency and inflexibility.
4.  a) If people define situations as real, they are real in their consequences || **Explanation:** The Thomas theorem states that people's perceptions of reality shape their behavior, regardless of whether those perceptions are accurate. If people believe something is real, they act on that belief.
5.  c) Assimilation || **Explanation:** Assimilation is the process by which members of a minority group adopt the cultural practices of the dominant group, often losing their original cultural identity in the process. This contrasts with multiculturalism, which preserves cultural diversity.
